# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer
* This project is inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A&t=941s
* The program uses python and pygame for algorithm visualization
* The implemented algorithm include:
  * A* Algorithm
  * Dijkstra's Algorithm
  * Breadth First Search (BFS)
  * Depth First Search (DFS)

# Instructions
* To run the program, run the env then run the base program:
  source env/bin/activate
  python3 path_find.py
* Select the start (blue) and end (red) point by left click, or cancel by right click
* Add barriers if you wish aafter selecting the start & end points
* Switch Algorithm by pressing the Right_Arrow on you keyboard
* Clean the map by pressing C on you keyboard
* run the algorithm by pressing SPACE
